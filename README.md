# Web-Developer-Bootcamp
Independent projects code

This is code that I've written during the course of studying an Udemy course entitled 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' 
by Colt Steele.

Whilst this projects are directed tasks, they have been coded independently by me utilising the most recent learning
at each stage of the course.
